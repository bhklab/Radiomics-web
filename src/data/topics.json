        "description": "Acquiring data, image processing, data federation, data cleaning, data exploration, model creation, model testing and model validation can all be time-consuming and challenging tasks, requiring clinicians to go into each source system, search for and acquire the data of interest, manually process images (often taking hours per image), federate the data with other sources (often spreadsheets), clean it, examine it, then often need help to create, test and validate models based on the data, with models being siloed on individual computers. The outputs of these models are what can be useful in the clinic. This has to be repeated across an entire cohort of patients. With MIRA, this data science workflow can be automated, saving on many time-consuming and repetitive steps, especially related to data wrangling, image processing and creating models for prediction and machine learning. It also allows for centralised storage of validated models.\nMIRA currently integrates with a number of source systems at UHN including RayStation, Pinnacle, Web Publishing, MOSAIQ, JDMI PACS and HPC4H."

Segmentation refers to the process of extracting the desired object (organ or region of interest (ROI)) from a medical image (2D or 3D), which can be done manually, semi-automatically or fully-automatically. It divides an image into areas based on a specified description, such as segmenting body organs/tissues for border detection, tumour detection/segmentation, and mass detection. The segmented ROIs can then be utilized for clinical workflows and downstream analysis.",

Manually accurate delineation of organs at risk (OARs) and targets is the most time-consuming aspect of a cervix brachytherapy procedure. To reduce the contouring time, this study aims to develop an automatic segmentation framework in female pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) images using deep learning (DL) techniques. This method holds great potential to improve contouring efficiency without clinically significant loss of accuracy and thus, improving plan accuracy and decreasing dosimetric uncertainty."
