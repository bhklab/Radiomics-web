"Benjamin Haibe-Kains", "benjamin-haibe-kains", "BHK", "Dr. Haibe-Kains is a Senior Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM), University Health Network, and Associate Professor in the Medical Biophysics department of the University of Toronto. Dr. Haibe-Kains earned his PhD in Bioinformatics at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium). Supported by a Fulbright Award, he did his postdoctoral fellowship at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health (USA). Since joining Princess Margaret in 2013, Dr. Haibe-Kains’ has established a multi-disciplinary research group which focuses on the integration of high-throughput data from various sources to simultaneously analyse multiple facets of carcinogenesis."
"Scott Bratman", "scott-bratman", "SVB", "Dr. Bratman is Senior Scientist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre Research Institute and Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology and Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. He received his MD and PhD from Columbia University in 2009 followed by postdoctoral research and clinical training at Stanford Cancer Institute. Since joining Princess Margaret in 2014, Dr. Bratman has served as Staff Radiation Oncologist within the Wharton Head and Neck Centre and has led basic, translational, and clinical research studies on head and neck cancer and circulating biomarkers. Dr. Bratman holds the Dr. Mariano Antonio Elia Chair in Head and Neck Cancer Research at UHN."
"Tom Purdie", "tom-purdie", "TP","Dr. Purdie is a clinician scientist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. His research is focused on developing machine learning algorithms and methods for automating clinical radiation oncology workflow processes, as well as more investigative research areas such as outcomes prediction incorporating radiation treatment information for radiomics. Another key component of his research is the dissemination and commercialization of technology. He has started a number of internal machine learning based studies in the Radiation Medicine Program and has also licensed core machine learning technology to companies that can promote the widespread clinical adoption of machine learning in radiation oncology and healthcare in general."
